I Had just started solving the assignments until I realized Laurence's videos had replaced my regular Netflix binging.

Very thankful for teachers like them and for platforms like Coursera. :) Working towards more such experience. "

He has made a full-functional prototype of the jeep and it got the attention of Anand Mahindra. The chassis is built using by GA square pipes welding. He has used an analog console taken from Royal Enfield motorcycle. For its leaf spring suspension mechanism, he used mantle plates taken from real jeeps. It is connected to the rear axle with the help of a chain sprocket system. He mounted a cloth hood on its roof that can also be folded like in the real one. A special toolkit has also been designed, which is placed under the driving seat. Two 24v DC batteries are used to charge the 24VDC electric motor. The Jeep also has a forward, neutral, and reverse gear. It weighs 75 kg, but can carry 150 kg. It comes with a charger and also sports regular and fog lamps.

"When I was at IIM Ahmedabad, I had the habit of taking afternoon naps. The classes would end by 1 15 pm. I would have lunch and wait for the quiz announcement until 1 45 pm. If there was no quiz, I would chit-chat with my wing-mates for some time and catch up on some much-needed sleep. I’d wake up in the evening feeling guilty for having wasted time. I’d hurriedly pick up my books and leave for the library.On my way, I’d pass the room of one of my batchmates. I always found him studying and that made me more anxious. Until one day, he came up to me and said, “dude, how do you study so much?” And I was confused. He further added, “you are always studying till late in the night”. And that day, I realized two things. One, I am not the only insecure person on the campus who is worried about failure. Two, everyone has their cycle of doing things. I always thought that I am not putting enough effort because I didn’t study in the afternoon. He thought he didn’t study enough because he slept at night. "
